 <h1 id="my-it-interests">My IT Interests</h1> 
 
<p class="p1" > Technology has changed the world we are living today and it will continue to do so as new technology is developed. Technology has always fascinated me. One reason is that technology allows people to communicate with each other online without having to meet face to face. This is a very convenient and quick way to communicate with family members and friends overseas. In our society, everyone including me uses technology everyday whether it be my laptop or my iphone to chat to people, study or for entertainment.
I am interested in designing websites 
 There are plenty reasons why technology is important and has changed our society as it allows people to do basically everything online without having to get out of the house. Such has ordering food at home and topping up myki card.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 <h2> When did your interest in IT begin?</h2> 
<p class="p1"> I remember in year 10 in high school I chose to do a coding class. I specifically remember having to make my own website using html. The assignment was to make a website to convince tourists to visit a place in Australia in which I chose to make mine about Luna Park. That was when I strated having an interest in IT. I am surrounded by technology and everyday I use technology whether it be my laptop or my iphone to study and to communicate with friends and people. </p>

<h2> 16 Personality Test Results</h2>


<img src="isfp-adventurer.jpg" style="width:430px;height:500px;" alt="isfp adventurer" class="center">

<p class="p1"> From the 16 personality results, I discovered that I have ISPF personality. ISFP personalities are called Adventurers. ISPF stands for Introverted, sensing, feeling and perceiving.
People who also have this personality like to live in the moment rather than plan for the future. Famous celebrities that also have Isfp personality include Micheal Jackson, Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne. Learn more about the ISPF personality <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality"target="_blank">here</a></p>




<p class="p1"> My results influences my behaviour because as an introvert public speaking is difficult and thus I don't like being the centre of attention. Moreover it is difficult to be close to people at first.</p>

<h2> Big 5 personality test results </h2>
<p class="p1"> The results from the Big 5 personality test results revealed that I scored 50% in openness, 48% in conscientiousness, 42% in extraversion, 70% in agreeableness and 35% in neuroticism. The highest area that I scored in was agreeableness. This means I tend to put other people's needs ahead of mine and I'd rather cooperate than compete with others. If you'd like to see your Big 5 personality test results, go to the<a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test"target="_blank"> Big 5 personality test.</a></p>

<h2>Learning test results</h2>
<p class="p1">From my learning test results, I discovered that I am a visual learner. I scored 45% as a visual learner, 40% as an auditory learner and 15% as a tactical learner.

<h1 id="my-project-idea"> My Project idea</h1>

<p style="border:7px; border-style:solid; border-color:#0E0800; padding: 1em;">My project will be a learning language app where users can compete with others online similar to the Australian website Mathletics where students do maths problems instead this app is for people that want to learn languages. Beginner learners will study the topics and compete with each other on easy topics such as the animals and colour. While advanced learners will compete on harder topics such as listening to a conversation and answering questions. There will be a chat section where users can talk to the people that are also learning the same language and can ask for help. They will improve their listening and talking skills by studying and repeating sentences and words with flipping flashcards.</p

<p style="border:7px; border-style:solid; border-color:#0E0800; padding: 1em;">This app is useful because learning more languages opens up to a world of job opportunities. Not everyone has time to study with a tutor as it not only is expensive but uses up precious time out of your day. Thus, people who are serious in wanting to learn a language, this language app would be perfect. My project offers a platform where people all over the world can participate in real time, live networked linguistic competitions. Similar to the Australian Mathletics app, users can compete with other users and will be exciting and fun but also beneficial for studying a language.
It has been found that one of the main benefits of speaking more than one language is referred to the executive function. They are the skills that allow you to control and manage your attention and your ability to plan. Studies have shown that bilingual people experience changes in the structure of their brain. There is an increase in the volume and density of hray matter, volume of white matter, and brain connectivity. </p>
<p style="border:7px; border-style:solid; border-color:#0E0800; padding: 1em;">
The four skills required to master a language is reading, speaking, writing and listening. This app provides all these skills.  
Users will improve their vocabulary of their chosen language with flashcards. For evey topic, users will be given new words to learn, They will be shown as flashcards where the word will be read by the app and users will repeat the word aloud. The flashcards can be flipped to show the english meaning of the word.
They will improve their listening and reading skills through audio recordings and reading sentences.
There will be questions to answer about them. When users become more advanced learners they will be answering the questions in the chosen language.

They will improve their writing by being expected to write the vocabulary learnt from the exercises. It will be up to the users if they want to study.

This global learning language app allows users to participate in real time, live networked linguistic competitions where users can compete and test their knowledge of topics . The test can be multiple choice or type answer questions. 
The questions that they get correct and incorrect will be shown at the end and a score willl be given. Before users participate in the linguistic competitions, they will study the topic being assessed. If users do well on the topic test and get half the questions correct, they will be able to level up and will unlock the next topic.
The app will keep track of your progress and will show the topics you have learnt. This will motivate users by seeing their progress.
Users can sign up with their social media accounts such as facebook, instagram or twitter. This way users can add each other and become friends.

Users will be able to level up when they finish a topic.</p>




<p style="border:7px; border-style:solid; border-color:#0E0800; padding: 1em;">
The app will available in three platforms which are IOS, Android, web-based. 

CSS3 and Bootstrap will be used for front end developent of the app.  For the backend, JavaScript, AngularJS, Python, Django, and Ruby will be used, and Java will be used for the android appp, and Swift will be used for IOS. 
Database developers can use MySQL, Cassandra, HBase.
To store progress of users, developers can use Amazon dat servers.</p>




<p style="border:7px; border-style:solid; border-color:#0E0800; padding: 1em;">
Skills needed to create this app is to be a good website designer. Since I am not, hiring professional illustrators and designers would be necessary. Since learning a language can be difficult and boring, it is important to make an appealing user interface design so language learning can be more interesting.
 As well as for hiring professional teachers and tutors and native speakers who are willing to write high quality studying material. This will make sure the minimum amount of mistakes in study materials.

Know how to promote the app. This is important because advertising is a way to popularise the app and to compete with other language learning apps.</p>







<p style="border:7px; border-style:solid; border-color:#0E0800; padding: 1em;">
If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?

If my project is successful, users would be effectively learning a language.
Since people are too busy to hire a tutor to learn a language, this app is convenient and easily accessible at anytime of the day. The app will be with you every step of the way and will track your progress and will motivate you to continue learning.
