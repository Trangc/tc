<h1>My IT interests</h1>

<p class="p1"> Technology has changed the world we are living today and it will continue to do so as new technology is developed. Technology has always fascinated me. One reason is that technology allows people to communicate with each other online without having to meet face to face. This is a very convenient and quick way to communicate with family members and friends overseas. In our society, everyone including me uses technology everyday whether it be my laptop or my iphone to chat to people, study or for entertainment.
I am interested in designing websites 
 There are plenty reasons why technology is important and has changed our society as it allows people to do basically everything online without having to get out of the house. Such has ordering food at home and topping up myki card.</p>

 <h2> When did your interest in IT begin?</h2> 
<p class="p1"> I remember in year 10 in high school I chose to do a coding class. I specifically remember having to make my own website using html. The assignment was to make a website to convince tourists to visit a place in Australia in which I chose to make mine about Luna Park. That was when I strated having an interest in IT. I am surrounded by technology and everyday I use technology whether it be my laptop or my iphone to study and to communicate with friends and people. </p>

<h2> Why RMIT? </h2>
<p class="p1">What made me want to go to RMIT university was when I went to RMIT with my high school in year 11 for an excursion.
We got to hear from RMIT students about their university experiences. They seemed very passionate about going to RMIT and gave me a good first impression. Also many past students from my high school went to RMIT so I chose RMIT. Not only this but it is in the city thus easy to commute to.

<h2> What do I expect to learn in RMIT?</h2>
<p class="p1">I expect to learn more about website designing, cyber security

<h1>My Personal profile</h1>
<h2> 16 personality test results</h2>
<p class="p1"> I have ISPF personality which means I'm an Adventurer. ISPF stands for Introverted, sensing, feeling and perceiving.
People who also have this personality like to live in the moment rather than plan for the future. Famous celebrities that also have Isfp personality include Micheal Jackson, Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne. Learn more about the ISPF personality <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality"target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p class="p1"> My results influences my behaviour because as an introvert public speaking is difficult and thus I don't like being the centre of attention. Moreover it is difficult to be close to people at first.</p>
